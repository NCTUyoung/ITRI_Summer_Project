# Result and Discussion

## Hidden structure of dataset

By analyze the hidden layer projection , we can find that feature vector has cluster shape distribution after traing. Moreover, we can observe sub-clusters in the scatter plot.

**Red sub-cluster** : handwrite one digit with right rotation   
**Purple sub-cluster** : handwrite one digit with no rotation  
We can even infer that right-handed digit one have occupy most of the mnist dataset. If we want to extend our datasets, we need to hair left-handed people to create new data.  


## Not all training data are trustful

Loss information bind with image could be meaning for our sensing. I propose top five loss image , and find peculiar label of datapoint.
